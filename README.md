I mainly cosplay my favorite characters on Pony Town! Please, do not copy or screenshot my ponies. ASK before you take inspo, if I say no, that means no. I am often matching with my boyfriend when he is on with me!!

C+H is alright! But if I am with friends & I don't know you, please wait until I am alone! ── I prefer whispers, so I'll be more likely to respond if you whisper me. I'll respond when I see it, no matter who I am with! Do keep in mind I am a pretty shy person, and it can take a little time for me to warm up. I also will probably feel less interested in a conversation if you're bland or dry, sorry. Green names please keep in mind I likely won't approach you if your with a group idk, sorry 

I can get pretty quiet sometimes, as I am on the phone a lot when I'm playing, or I just don't feel like typing. But I'll do my best to respond!

Past beef is irrelevant to me. Unless you're like the most insufferable person on earth, then I really don't care to interact with you as long as you aren't trying to start something again.

Basic dni, obviously, that includes proshippers because somehow people forget that's a part of the basic dni? lmao. If you whitewash Shidou (AKA, 95% of Shidou's on Ponytown.) ── more on rentry.
