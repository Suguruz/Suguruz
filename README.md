  Please whisper to interact. I am likely not paying attention unless I'm actively engaging in public chat.

  I'm an anxious person in general, so I apologize if I seem uninterested! I'm likely just nervous is all. Please reframe from c+h when I am with friends, but feel free to whisper me! This does not apply if we are already friends, just sit with me if you find me ^_^ Please be aware that if I find you odd or am put off by you, I'm going to stop interacting. I won't be rude or anything but I will try to make it clear that I am not interested in being buddy buddy with you. Do not invovle me in drama with ppl just bc I know someone who is invovled. You're free to inform me, as that is important a lot of the times, but I will form my own opinion on the matter and move on.

I'm a pretty opinionated person, if you ask me how I feel about something I'm going to say how I feel about it. Obviously, I don't really give a shit if you have a differing opinion on things that don't matter. No, I don't care if you like a ship I don't unless its a proship or just weird. I'm not really big on headcanons on identity headcanons. I don't care if you are, but just don't push it on me.

Proshippers and their varients do not interact with me. I don't care for your reasoning or how you attempt to explain it. I know what it is and I do not want to interact with you if you are a proshipper or are proship neutral.
